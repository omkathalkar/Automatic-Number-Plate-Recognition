This demo allows you to upload an image of a vehicle with a visible license plate and view the detected plate along with the recognized characters in real-time.

## Overview
This project implements an **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System** leveraging **YOLOv11** for license plate detection and **PaddleOCR** for character recognition. The system is designed to efficiently recognize Indian vehicle license plates under diverse real-world conditions, making it suitable for traffic management, law enforcement, and parking enforcement applications.

## Features
- **State-of-the-art deep learning models** for plate detection and character recognition.
- **Optimized image preprocessing** for handling challenging conditions (low-light, skewed angles, occlusions).
- **High accuracy performance** with **92.3% mAP@0.5** for detection and **89.1% OCR accuracy**.
- **Efficient processing speed** (~150ms per image), optimized for real-time applications.
- **Modular and scalable architecture**, allowing further improvements and real-world deployment.
- **Deployed on Hugging Face and local servers** for easy accessibility.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Collection
- Dataset sources: **Google Images and OLX (state-wise dataset)**
- Total dataset: **800 training images, 50 validation images, and a test set**
- Images are labeled with bounding boxes using XML annotation files.

### 2. Tools and Technologies

### 3. Implementation Steps
#### a) Data Preprocessing
- XML parsing for extracting bounding boxes.
- Image normalization and augmentation (rotation, scaling, shearing).
- Data validation checks to ensure correct format and consistency.

#### b) Model Training
- **YOLOv11 Training:**
  - 200 epochs, batch size of 16.

- **OCR (PaddleOCR) Training:**
  - Grayscale conversion and adaptive thresholding for binarization.
  - Noise reduction to improve character recognition accuracy.

#### c) License Plate Detection & OCR
- YOLOv11 detects license plate regions in images.
- Detected plates are extracted and passed to PaddleOCR.
- Preprocessing applied: grayscale conversion, thresholding, and denoising.
- OCR extracts and verifies recognized characters.

#### d) Visualization & Logging
- Results visualized with bounding boxes and recognized text overlay.
- Performance monitored via logs capturing **detection time, OCR accuracy, and errors**.

### 4. Experimental Setup
- **Hardware:** NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU (CUDA 11.2), 16GB RAM.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Detection:** Mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) - **92.3%**
  - **OCR Accuracy:** Character-wise - **89.1%**, Word-wise - **85.4%**
  - **Processing Time:** ~150ms per image.
- Evaluated across different lighting conditions and plate designs.

## Results
- **High detection and recognition accuracy** (exceeding benchmarks of comparable systems).
- **Adaptive thresholding improved low-light accuracy by 18.5%.**
- **Optimized batch processing reduced latency by 25%.**
- **Model performed well under diverse conditions, including occlusions and angle distortions.**
